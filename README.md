## TINY COMPILER IN C
I have always wanted to learn C. I will try to make a compiler in C following this tutorial: https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj/tree/master
I have in mind trying to customize it once i undestand it enough.

When i have more time, i will try to do the same in rust or another language.
